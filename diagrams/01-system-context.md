# System context diagram

A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to
step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users
and the other systems that it interacts with.

Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape. The focus
should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies, protocols and other
low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.

## Scope

A single software system.

## Primary elements

The software system in scope.

## Supporting elements

People (e.g. users, actors, roles, or personas) and software systems (external dependencies) that are directly connected
to the software system in scope. Typically these other software systems sit outside the scope or boundary of your
own software system, and you don't have responsibility or ownership of them.

## Intended audience

Everybody, both technical and non-technical people, inside and outside the software development team.

## Recommended?

Yes, a system context diagram is recommended for all software development teams.
