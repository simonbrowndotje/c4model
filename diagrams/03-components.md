## Scope

A single container.

## Primary elements

Components within the container in scope.

## Supporting elements

Containers (within the software system in scope) plus people and software systems directly connected to the components.

## Intended audience

Software architects and developers.

## Recommended?

No, only create component diagrams if you feel they add value, and consider automating their creation
for long-lived documentation.
