# Component diagram

Next you can zoom in and decompose a container to describe the [components](/abstractions/component)
that reside inside it; including their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.

## Example

[![A component diagram](/images/examples/Components.png)](/images/examples/Components.png)

### Diagram key

[![A diagram key](/images/examples/Components-key.png)](/images/examples/Components-key.png)

## Scope

A single container.

## Primary elements

Components within the container in scope.

## Supporting elements

Containers (within the software system in scope) plus people and software systems directly connected to the components.

## Intended audience

Software architects and developers.

## Recommended?

No, only create component diagrams if you feel they add value, and consider automating their creation
for long-lived documentation.
