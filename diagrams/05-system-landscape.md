# System landscape diagram

The system context, container, component, and code diagrams are designed to provide a static view of
a __single software system__ but, in the real-world, software systems never live in isolation. For this reason,
and particularly if you are responsible for a collection/portfolio of software systems,
it's often useful to understand how all of these software systems fit together within a given enterprise, 
organisation, department, etc. Essentially this is a map of the software systems within the chosen scope, with a
set of system context, container, component, and code diagrams for each software system of interest.

From a practical perspective, a system landscape diagram is really just a system context diagram without a
specific focus on a particular software system.
