# Dynamic diagram

A dynamic diagram can be useful when you want to show how elements in the static model collaborate at runtime to
implement a user story, use case, feature, etc. This dynamic diagram is based upon a
[UML communication diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram)
(previously known as a "UML collaboration diagram"). It is similar to a
[UML sequence diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) although it allows
a free-form arrangement of diagram elements with numbered interactions to indicate ordering.

## Example (collaboration style)

### Diagram key

## Example (sequence style)

## Scope

A particular feature, story, use case, etc.

## Primary and supporting elements

Your choice - you can show software systems, containers, or components interacting at runtime.

## Intended audience

Technical and non-technical people, inside and outside the software development team.

## Recommended?

No, dynamic diagrams should be used sparingly to show interesting/recurring patterns or features that require a
complicated set of interactions.

## Notes

The collaboration and sequence styles show the same information in a different way,
so feel free to use whichever you prefer.
