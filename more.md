## Who is using C4?

Simon has personally taught the C4 model to 10,000+ people in 30+ countries;
with conference talks, videos, books, and articles reaching many more than this.
Other people are also teaching, speaking, and writing about the C4 model,
plus it's been [integrated into a number of tools](/tooling).
Here are some case studies:

- Spotify: [Spotify Engineering: Software Visualization - Challenge, Accepted](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/07/software-visualization-challenge-accepted/)
- Boots: [The Engineering Leader: A Moment on C4 Architectural Design with Amar Mehan](https://www.theengineeringleader.com/1946930/10648894-a-moment-on-c4-architectural-design-with-amar-mehan)
- Decathlon: [Navigating Software Architecture at Scale: Insights from Decathlon’s Architecture Process](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/07/decathlon-architecture-process/)
- Co-op: [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/popovdenys_diagramming-platforms-architecture-activity-7220039863813763073-1XQ3/)
