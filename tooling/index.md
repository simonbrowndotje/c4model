# Tooling

For design sessions, you might find a whiteboard or flip chart paper better for collaboration, and iterating quickly.
For long-lived documentation, there are a number of tools can help create software architecture diagrams based upon
the C4 model. Here are some of the questions you should ask yourself when looking at tooling:

- Who are the diagram authors, and how technical are they?
- Who is the diagram audience, and how will they access the diagrams/documentation?
- [Diagramming](/tooling/diagramming) or [modelling](/tooling/modelling)?
- A "drag and drop" UI or "diagrams as code"?
- Data stored in git next to your source code or stored in the tool/cloud service?
- Easy to diff source to use in pull requests?
- Open or closed data format?
- Interactive or static diagrams?
- Free or paid?
- Open or closed source?
- Cloud or self-hosted?
- Short-lived or long-lived documentation?
- Team only diagramming or enterprise-wide modelling?

## Tools

The [diagramming](/tooling/diagramming#tools) and [modelling](/tooling/modelling#tools) pages both have lists of tools
that support the C4 model. Please
[get in touch](mailto:hello@architectis.je?subject=C4%20model%20-%20tool%20addition) to ask about adding
your tool to these lists, with the following information:

- Name
- Short description
- URL
- Open source (include link to repo) or closed source?
